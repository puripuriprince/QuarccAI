Do not confuse the dates you see in the examples in this guide with the actual current term dates and information. Step 1 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Academic advising Academic advising The requirements for advising prior to registration vary according to your program of study. To determine if you require advising refer to the Holds box on your Student Center page or go to your Faculty or School\u00e2\u0080\u0099s advising information page by clicking on the appropriate link below. How to contact your academic advisor: In most cases, you will be assigned an academic advisor for your main plan of study and potentially for any additional plans that you may have. You can easily see the advisor information from the homepage of your student centre: This displays the name of your individual adviso", "r or advising team along with their contact telephone number (if available). If you click on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cdetails\u00e2\u0080\u009d link, you will see a breakdown of which advisor or advising team relates to each of your plans. If available, and depending on the email program you are using, you can click on the link where the name of the advisor or advising team is shown. This will allow you to email your advisor. If there is no link, then no email address has been provided and you should use the contact phone number to reach your advisor. NOTE: If you are using an internet email client such as Gmail, you can hover the cursor over the link and the email address will be displayed in the bottom left of your screen. Alternatively, depending on the browser you are using, you can right-click on the link and select \u00e2\u0080\u0098copy email address\u00e2\u0080\u0099. You may then paste the address into your email client. You can also get more information about advising from the links below: \u00c2\u00bb Arts and Science \u00c2\u00bb John Molson School of Bus", "iness \u00c2\u00bb Engineering and Computer Science \u00c2\u00bb Fine Arts \u00c2\u00bb Independent students Step 2 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Accessing registration Register for courses. You can also find the link to register on to the\u00a0Student Hub's My CU Account page. If you are on a mobile device or a tablet, click the Enroll tile to begin your registration process. If you are using a desktop, you can access the enrollment functions from the left-hand navigation Enrollment dropdown or by clicking on Enroll on the right. Step 3 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Plan your timetable To assist you in planning your timetable we have included information on how to look for courses three different ways: A \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Use the Concordia Class Schedule Builder The Concordia Class Schedule Builder is a tool to assist you to generate a workable personalized class schedule with ease based on the published class schedule. B \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Use the Class Search You can search for a range of classes based on specific criteria you can define. C \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Browse the Course Catalog This is a comprehensive li", "sting of courses offered at Concordia University. Please note the following: Test Results If you plan on registering for English Composition or ESL (English as a Second Language) courses and have written the appropriate placement test, your results will be sent to you by e-mail. REQUISITES Pre-requisites \u00e2\u0080\u0093 These are usually either specific classes you must have taken or a minimum number of completed credits before you can register for a given class. Co-requisites \u00e2\u0080\u0093 These are classes that need to be taken at the same time (or previously) to be able to register for a given class. Anti-requisites\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0093 These are other classes for which you must not have previously received credit (including any transfer credit or exemptions) to register for a given class. For example, MARK495 is an anti-requisite of MARK301. To register for MARK301, students should not have previously taken and received credit for MARK495. The reason for these types of requirements are to stop students taking courses ou", "t of sequence or taking a higher level course and then trying to take a lower level course that may have similar content. You should consult the Undergraduate Calendar to see the requisites for the course in which you want to register. If you receive a message about \u00e2\u0080\u0098 requisites not met\u00e2\u0080\u0099 when trying to register for a class, you should ensure that you have met all of the requisites as stated in the Undergraduate Calendar. If you believe that you have then you will need to speak to your department (JMSB students, please contact the Undergraduate Student Affairs Office)\u00a0so that they can look into this matter for you. Degree/Certificate students : You are not permitted to register for a course that has a prerequisite if you have not completed that prerequisite. If you have received authorization from an academic advisor to register for a course without the stated prerequisite, the advisor must enter a waiver that will permit you access to the course. Independent/Visiting students: If y", "ou wish to register for courses where the prerequisite was completed elsewhere, you must complete a \u00e2\u0080\u009cPrerequisite Waiver Form\u00e2\u0080\u009d and receive approval prior to registering. Note that you must include specific details of the course, including the course name and number, where and when it was completed, as well as the course description and transcripts.\u00a0This form is available at the Birks Student Service Centre . (also available at Student requests & forms ) RESERVE SEATS IN CLASSES Some classes have seats reserved for students in specific programs. This is usually done to ensure that students who need the class as part of their program can register in it. Depending on the rules defined by the department that offers the class, they may set all, some, or none of the seats as reserved. If you try to register for a class and receive a message about \u00e2\u0080\u009c reserved seats\u00e2\u0080\u009d then you should select another class or consult the department or the Undergraduate Student Affairs Office, for JMSB stud", "ents to obtain permission to take the class. DEPARTMENT CONSENT Some classes may require that you first obtain department permission to take the class. If you receive a message that states: \u00e2\u0080\u009c Department Consent Required \u00e2\u0080\u009d, you will need to speak to the department that offers the class to obtain permission to register. JMSB students will need to contact the Undergraduate Student Affairs Office .

To view details of the course, click on the Section to obtain further information about the course. If satisfied that you wish to enroll in this course, choose \u00e2\u0080\u009c select\u00e2\u0080\u009d . Confirm the class information. If the section selected also requires you to register for additional components such as labs, tutorials, conferences, etc. you will be required to make that choice before proceeding further: Once you have selected the conference, press Next . You will receive confirmation that the course has been added to your Course Cart. NOTE: Having a course added to your Course Cart does not mean that you are registered in the course.

If your registration was successful you will see the following message: If it was unsuccessful, you will receive an error explaining what the problem is and what you must do to rectify the situation. Here is just one possible example: For Example, the above message is informing you that Departmental Consent is required before you can register in this course. It would be necessary for you to contact the relevant Department to obtain the necessary consent. In other instances, you may be denied registration in a course that appears to have seats available. This is caused by the Department/Faculty having reserved seats for students in a particular department or program of study. Remember to register for all terms Summer, Fall, Fall/Winter and Winter at the same time \u00e2\u0080\u0093 do not wait until later in the Fall to register for your Winter courses as you may find them filled to capacity. B \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Dropping classes Please note: If you only want to change section", "s of the same course, see Step 6, C \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Swapping classes. There are three easy steps to dropping a class from your schedule but there are two different types of course withdrawals and both are controlled by deadline dates shown in the Term Dates and Deadlines . Please note the following important details: DNE \u00e2\u0080\u0093 did not enter \u00e2\u0080\u0093 The DNE date is generally one to two weeks after the first day of classes. A withdrawal (drop) before the DNE deadline date is treated as if you were never in the course. There will be no entry on your student record for that course and you will not be charged tuition and other fees for that course. If you have already paid for the course, you will receive financial credit for course fees. DISC \u00e2\u0080\u0093 discontinue \u00e2\u0080\u0093 The DISC date is later in the term. An academic withdrawal (drop) after the DNE date, but before the DISC deadline date allows you to stop attending that course with no academic penalty. Unlike the DNE, however, the course will remain on your studen", "t record with an entry of DISC and you will be held financially responsible for the payment of 100% of tuition and other fees, including the Winter portion of a full-year course. Not attending classes, or informing an instructor of an intent to withdraw, does not constitute an official withdrawal, nor does it entitle a student to a refund of fees or cancellation of registration. Without formally dropping the course by the appropriate academic withdrawal deadline, non-attendance of a class will result in the assignment of a failing grade. If you enroll in a fall term course that is a prerequisite for a winter course and later drop the fall course, the Faculty/Department involved will run a process at the beginning of the winter term to ensure that all students registered in a course with prerequisites have successfully completed that prerequisite. Once the add/drop deadline for a term has passed, you will not have the option to select that term. If you have a financial hold, you will be", " able to drop classes, but you will not be able to add classes. If you intend to replace a dropped class with a new class, ensure that all financial holds are cleared. For additional information regarding the add/drop deadlines, refer to the Term Dates and Deadlines link in the Important Information section of the Student Center page. NAVIGATION: Academics > Enroll > Drop NOTE: If you receive an error message stating \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are not authorized for self service enrollment at this time\u00e2\u0080\u009d when you click on the Drop tab, you will need to click the \u00e2\u0080\u009cchange term\u00e2\u0080\u009d button and then follow the steps below. Select a specific term from the list of current terms that are displayed in the table. Once the add/drop deadline for a term has passed that term will no longer be available for selection from the table. Click the Continue button. All registered classes for the term will be displayed in a grid. Multi-component classes will display all registered sections. Select the class(es) you want to d", "rop and click the Drop Selected Classes button. Note that you can drop multiple courses at once if you wish to do so. Select the My class Schedule button to retrieve your class schedule and confirm that the class(es) are no longer shown OR if they are, that they correctly show the status as Dropped or DSC. C \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Swapping classes (including Section changes) You can swap one course for another or one section for a different one. The process is a combination of add and drop. The swap function allows you to verify the availability of another course or section of the same course before you make a decision. There is, therefore, no risk of losing the section you have if another section is not available. DO NOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES , use the drop and add features to accomplish a section change. If you drop the section that you are currently registered for and then find out that no spaces are available in other sections, you may not be able to get back into the section you were originally r", "egistered in as another student may have taken your place once you dropped the course. There are some restrictions attached to swapping classes: If you have a financial hold you will not be able to swap any classes until you clear the hold. Classes can only be swapped until the add/drop deadline for a given term. For additional information regarding the add/drop deadlines, refer to the Term Dates and Deadlines link in the Important Information section of the Student Center page. If you are not enrolled in any classes you will not have access to swap classes. The swap feature should not be used to swap between summer classes in different summer sessions. For example, do not use it to swap from a May to June course into a June to August course or from a full summer (May to August) course into either a May to June course or a June to August course. To swap a component of a multi-component class while keeping one or more of the other components (for example, swap HIST 202 Lec A, Conf AA fo", "r HIST 202 Lec A, Conf BB while keeping the same lecture) see the section entitled Swapping Multi-Component Classes. NAVIGATION: Academics > Enroll > Swap Select a specific term from the list of current terms that are displayed in the table. Click the Continue button. The first grid on this page called, Swap This Class , displays a list of classes in which you are currently enrolled. The next section, called With This Class, allows you to search for a class using the class search feature, or to select from your Course Cart, or to enter the Class Nbr if you already know it. Select the class that you wish to swap from with the Swap This Class grid. Select the class that you want to swap to using the With This class grid. If you use the search feature and identify a course, you will be asked to choose the section you want by using the \u00e2\u0080\u009cselect class\u00e2\u0080\u009d button and you are then re-directed to the Confirm your selection page. If you Select from your Course Cart, using the select button next", " to that option takes you to the Confirm your selection page. If you use the Enter Class Nrb feature and press enter you will eventually reach the Confirm your selection page. Confirm your selection and click the Finish Swapping button. If the swap is unsuccessful either follow the instructions in the error message or try another course by selecting SWAP from the menu bar: View My Class Schedule to verify the status of your swap transaction: Swapping multi-component classes (while keeping one or more of the other components) Search for the class using the search function in the With this class grid. You will be prompted to make a selection for all required components even if you want to keep the same sections in which you are already enrolled. Confirm your selection. All related components of a class will be displayed. Verify the swap transaction. View My Class Schedule to ensure that the class has been swapped in your registration. PLEASE NOTE \u00e2\u0080\u0093 If you try to swap one of your compon", "ents for another one that is currently on a waitlist, then you will be placed on the waitlist for ALL components of the class and potentially lose your place in the class. If you do not want to take this risk, then do not use the swap feature to swap components if your preferred component is on a waitlist. For example: You are currently enrolled in COMP248 Lecture U, Tutorial U UA and Laboratory UI-X. You want to stay in Lecture U and Laboratory UI-X, but swap the tutorial for U UB (which is on a waitlist). If you attempt to do this using a swap, you will lose your existing places in Lecture U, Tutorial U UA and Laboratory UI-X and be placed on the waitlist for Lecture U, Tutorial U UB and Laboratory UI-X. D \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Wait listing classes Once all seats in a course have been filled it may still be possible for you to add your name to a wait list. Academic departments have the choice of offering wait list seats or not. To determine which courses will allow you to add your name to a wait list:", " NAVIGATION: Academics > Search Select the term Select the subject Select the course number Search Once the results of the search are displayed, click on the Section hyperlink: You are now on the Class Detail page which indicates whether a Wait List is available for the course selected and it is also indicated what the wait list capacity is for the course and the Wait List total. This tells you that 80 students can add their name to a wait list after the class capacity of 770 has been reached. There are two scenarios under which you may add your name to a wait list. You have not yet enrolled in your maximum course load so that if a seat becomes available you would be eligible to add it to your other courses for that term. You have enrolled in your maximum course load but you set-up your name on a wait list using the swap feature so that if a seat does become available, you would swap one course for another. Scenario 1 You start the registration process by trying to register for ECON 20", "1 but the course is full and you get the following error message: You use the class search described above to see the detail of the course and determine that a wait list is available and that there is still room for you to add your name. Knowing this, you select the course again and tick the box labelled Wait list if class is full and select next. You will see the resulting message: If a seat opens up in this course and you satisfy all the necessary requirements you will be registered automatically and notified via e-mail accordingly. The registration in this course could take place as late as one day before the deadline to drop courses (DNE) without financial penalty. Scenario 2 If you are permitted to enroll in 15 credits in the fall term and you have already reached that capacity but still want the possibility of entering INTE 123, you would use the Swap This Class grid to identify which of your courses you would swap. You would then go to the With This Class grid and enter the cour", "se. You will then follow the normal steps to get to the point where you identify that you want to \u00e2\u0080\u009c Wait list if class is full\u00e2\u0080\u009d . If a seat opens up in this course and you satisfy all the necessary requirements you will be swapped from one course to the other automatically and notified via e-mail accordingly. The registration in this course could take place as late as one day before the deadline to drop courses (DNE) without financial penalty. Some tips about wait lists You can wait list for a maximum of 6 units per term. You cannot be wait listed for two sections of the same course. You can remove your name from a wait list by using the drop feature. Note: Adding your name to a waitlist does NOT guarantee that you will get into the class. IMPORTANT NOTE: If you are on a waitlist for a course, it does not mean that you are actually registered for the course. You will only be registered into the course if a seat becomes available and the system registers you into the class based on ", "your waitlist position. Step 7 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Verify your courses You can verify your schedule in two different formats. From your Student Center page, you can choose weekly schedule. The resulting \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy Class Schedule\u00e2\u0080\u009d page allows you to select the term for which you wish to verify your registrations. After selecting the term, press continue.
